### How it works 

First, specify how your artboards should link to one another. E.g. If clicking a button on artboard 1 should take user to artboard 2, select the button layer and run the `Link selected layer to...` command. Then select artboard 2 in the pop up that apprers. You can also fix layers to one of the four positions. If you got a fixed nav, this can be handy. 

Once done with the set up, run the `Export to HTML`.


| Command                   | Description |
|:------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------|
| Link selected layer to... | Select the artboard you want this layer to link to. The layer will be prefixed with [linkto:artbaord] |
| Fix selected layer to...  | Select the position this layer should be fixed to. The layer will be prefixed with [fixed:position] |
| Export to HTML            | A folder will be created in the destination you selected, named after the Sketch file. |

### Limitations

1. Only the artboards of the current page will be exported.
2. A layer you wish to link or fix has to be a top-level layer, meaning it cannot be nested inside another layer.
3. Make sure each artboard in the page has a unique name.
