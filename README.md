#### Fix layers
You can also fix layers to one of the four positions. If you got a fixed nav, this can be handy.

## Full Command List ##

| Command                     | Description |
|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| Link selected layer to...   | Link a layer to an artboard in the current page |
| Fix selected layer to...    | Fix a layer to one of the four positions: top, right, bottom, left  |
| Export to HTML              | Export current page artboards into html files, in a folder named after the Sketch file |

| Clear current page          | Clear all the HTML options set in the current page |
| Show HTML config for selected artboard | Get an alert message listing HTML options set for current artboard |

## Limitations ##

1. Only the artboards of the current page will be exported.

~~2. A layer you wish to link or fix has to be a top-level layer, meaning it cannot be nested inside another layer.~~

3. Make sure each artboard in the page has a unique name.

## What's next? ##
- [ ] Remove limitation #1 - perhaps user selects which pages
- [x] ~~Remove limitation #2 - Link or fix nested layers~~
- [x] ~~Open folder after export~~
- [ ] Export for mobile apps - artboards embedded in a mobile frame, similar to Invision
